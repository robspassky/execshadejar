execshadejar

OVERVIEW

This is a bare-bones maven project that builds an all-in-one executable 
jar. It's meant to be copied and re-used for other projects, exactly
like a maven artifact. I would like to upload it somewhere so it can
become freely available, but I don't know how. So for now, it sits in
github.

A CLI library, JCommander is included by default to demonstrate that
dependencies are rolled into the resulting jar.

The latest (as of this time) junit is included, 4.10, and a pair
of test classes are included to demonstrate annotation-based testing.

USAGE

Write your own code. Modify pom.xml to have the main method you want
invoked if the jar file is directly executed via java -jar.
